Vim cpp omnicompletion and php omnicompletion requires the precence of ctags
tags. Originally I made a shortcut to recreate the tags file, but I found it to
be on the way.

This is my second attempt on automating tags creation. It recursively finds all
the subdirectories, listens to them and if a suitable file is modified, the
tags file is updated.
